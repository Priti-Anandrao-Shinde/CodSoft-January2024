# ATM Interface
This is the 3rd task of my [CodSoft](https://www.codsoft.in) Java Programming Internship

# What we have to do

- [x] Create a class to represent the ATM machine. 

- [x] Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
checking the balance.

- [x] Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.

- [x] Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
checkBalance().

- [x] Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
balance.

of their transactions.
